//App Logic

//create new project class/object with project name and tasks array

//add new project to an array that will be later displayed to the DOM

//create new task class/object with title, description, priority, and due date
//collected from the user and add to the task array

//user selects their tasks for their created projects to add, edit or delete

//organize all tasks based on when they are due, if they are important, and if 
//they are completed



//DOM Logic

//display all projects from project array in the main section

//add project button that calls new project class to make project

//add task button that calls new task class to create a task

//all tasks section that displays all task array elements from all projects

//other tabs that display tasks from all projects based on some criteria
