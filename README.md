## Features:

* Updates changes in real time
* Tasks and projects kept separate
* Working tabs that update when clicked on

## Reflection:

* Got better at using separate modules
* Better utilization of arrays
* Better usage and understanding of function use and structure
* CSS styling becoming second-natures
